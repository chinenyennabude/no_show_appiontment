# NoShowAppointment

In this project I performed Data wrangling on the **noshowappiontment** dataset. The dataset contains information of 100k medical appiontment in brazil and was originally sourced from kaggle.

I explored the dataset with univariate and multivariate visualisations in order to answer the question: _What features are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment_.
